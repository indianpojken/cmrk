## Shopping list

| Part                             | Quantity |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Pro Micro Controller             | 1        |
| SOD-123 SMD or 1N4148 THT diodes | 34       |
| Kailh Hotswap MX-sockets         | 34       |
| MX-switches                      | 34       |
| Keycaps                          | 34       |

I suggest making the controller hotswappable as well.
